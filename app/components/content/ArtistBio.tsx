          <strong>Phantom Drum</strong> is built on moody synth layers, chopped
          vocals, organic funk patterns and dusty records.

          The debut, <em>INITIALIZE</em>, is an instrumental deep-dive into mood
          and texture. Ten songs, meticulously composed, embark on a search for
          the line between chaos and comfort.

          How many layers can a dang beat have? INITIALIZE seeks to answer this
          question through samples, synthesizers and drum machines.

          Ultimately, this work is a study in density. Phantom Drum blends the
          sample-heavy warmth of Gorillaz with the rhythmic fracture of Aphex
          Twin.
